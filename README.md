# Hello, I'm Brandon!

[Information Technology Professional](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandon-kinal-463a8b219/)  
Aspiring SOC Analyst | Blue Team Focus | SQL | Incident Response  
Portfolio is a **work in progress** and updated **daily**

## [Windows Security & Active Directory](https://github.com/bekinal/Windows-Security-Active-Directory)  
System administration and security configuration labs that reflect my ability to **manage, harden, and monitor enterprise Windows environments** â€” critical skills for SOC Analysts working in real-world infrastructures, especially in AD-heavy corporate networks.

## [Networking](https://github.com/bekinal/Networking/blob/main/README.md)  
This lab series highlights my **hands-on experience with configuring, analyzing, and securing enterprise network infrastructure**. These skills allow me to **detect abnormal network behavior**, identify misconfigurations, and understand how attacks propagate through network layers â€” all essential for effective threat detection and incident response.
