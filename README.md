Hey, Iâ€™m Brandon â€” an aspiring AWS Cloud Engineer with a background in Technical Support and Incident Response. Iâ€™ve spent the past few years working in SaaS environments â€” managing hosted applications, troubleshooting complex issues, and learning how cloud infrastructure supports reliable, scalable systems.

Over time, Iâ€™ve become passionate about cloud architecture and automation â€” building, securing, and optimizing environments that help applications run smoothly at scale.

This GitHub is where I document what Iâ€™m learning as I transition into cloud engineering â€” from:

Deploying and managing resources with Terraform and CloudFormation

Automating builds and deployments with CI/CD pipelines

Working with AWS services like EC2, S3, Lambda, CloudFront, and DynamoDB

Designing secure, cost-efficient cloud architectures

Iâ€™m building a portfolio that reflects how I think, what I know, and how I approach problem-solving in real-world AWS environments.

Below is a collection of a few labs I completed when first beginning my career in IT. Having a strong foundation is fundamental in an evolving career path. Feel free to take a look!

A majority of my cloud-based projects will be documented on my AWS hosted portfolio [here!](https://resume.brandonkinalcloud.com)

### The Basics
This section covers key labs in Windows security, networking, AWS cloud basics, and Linux system administration. These projects demonstrate my skills in managing and securing IT environments, forming a strong foundation for cloud roles with a strong security posture. This section is fairly large, so I broke it down into collections for ease of access.

  <summary><strong>Lab Collections</strong></summary>

## [Windows Security & Active Directory](https://github.com/bekinal/Windows-Security-Active-Directory)  
System administration and security configuration labs that reflect my ability to **manage, harden, and monitor enterprise Windows environments** â€” critical skills for SOC Analysts working in real-world infrastructures, especially in AD-heavy corporate networks.

## [Networking](https://github.com/bekinal/Networking)  
This lab series highlights my **hands-on experience with configuring, analyzing, and securing enterprise network infrastructure**. These skills allow me to **detect abnormal network behavior**, identify misconfigurations, and understand how attacks propagate through network layers â€” all essential for effective threat detection and incident response.

## [AWS Cloud Basics & Security](https://github.com/bekinal/AWS-Cloud-Basics-Security-)  
This section highlights my hands-on experience deploying and securing cloud resources in AWS. With cloud adoption continuing to accelerate, SOC Analysts are increasingly expected to understand cloud-native infrastructure, IAM, billing controls, and perimeter defenses. These labs demonstrate my ability to build, monitor, and defend cloud environments â€” preparing me for real-world detection and response scenarios in the cloud.

## [Linux Security](https://github.com/bekinal/Linux-Security)  
This lab collection demonstrates my ability to secure, audit, and automate Linux environments â€” skills increasingly vital for SOC Analysts in hybrid infrastructures. From access controls and backup scripting to service hardening and integrity monitoring, these projects show I can detect misconfigurations, maintain secure baselines, and respond to incidents in Linux systems.
