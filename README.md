Hey, Iâ€™m Brandon â€” a tech enthusiast on a mission to break into cybersecurity as a SOC Analyst. My background is in application support, incident response, and solving complex issues under pressure. Over time, I found myself drawn to the blue team side of security â€” digging into alerts, tracing unusual behavior, and figuring out how systems get compromised.

This GitHub is where Iâ€™m documenting everything Iâ€™m learning: from setting up Windows and Linux environments to writing detection rules and analyzing network traffic. Iâ€™m building out a portfolio that reflects how I think, what I know, and how I approach problem-solving in real-world scenarios.

If youâ€™re on a similar path â€” or just curious â€” feel free to explore the labs, reach out, or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandon-kinal-463a8b219/)

Happy hunting.

## [Windows Security & Active Directory](https://github.com/bekinal/Windows-Security-Active-Directory)  
System administration and security configuration labs that reflect my ability to **manage, harden, and monitor enterprise Windows environments** â€” critical skills for SOC Analysts working in real-world infrastructures, especially in AD-heavy corporate networks.

## [Networking](https://github.com/bekinal/Networking)  
This lab series highlights my **hands-on experience with configuring, analyzing, and securing enterprise network infrastructure**. These skills allow me to **detect abnormal network behavior**, identify misconfigurations, and understand how attacks propagate through network layers â€” all essential for effective threat detection and incident response.

## [AWS Cloud Basics & Security](https://github.com/bekinal/AWS-Cloud-Basics-Security-)  
This section highlights my hands-on experience deploying and securing cloud resources in AWS. With cloud adoption continuing to accelerate, SOC Analysts are increasingly expected to understand cloud-native infrastructure, IAM, billing controls, and perimeter defenses. These labs demonstrate my ability to build, monitor, and defend cloud environments â€” preparing me for real-world detection and response scenarios in the cloud.

## [Linux Security](https://github.com/bekinal/Linux-Security)  
This lab collection demonstrates my ability to secure, audit, and automate Linux environments â€” skills increasingly vital for SOC Analysts in hybrid infrastructures. From access controls and backup scripting to service hardening and integrity monitoring, these projects show I can detect misconfigurations, maintain secure baselines, and respond to incidents in Linux systems.
